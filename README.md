## Motivation
Amongst role-playing games, the [Might and Magic series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic) remains unique in that it implements a party-based system similar to other traditional [Dungeons and Dragons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Dungeons_%26_Dragons_video_games) type games while also having gameplay that takes place in real-time from a first-person perspective.

Other real-time first-person RPGs have remained popular to the present day, most notably the [Elder Scrolls series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Elder_Scrolls), but no game in the modern era has successfully recreated the core gameplay systems that made the Might and Magic series so compelling.

When playing the more highly regarded entries in the series, such as [Might and Magic VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic_VI:_The_Mandate_of_Heaven) and [Might and Magic VII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_and_Magic_VII:_For_Blood_and_Honor), it is immediately apparent that many of the low-level design decisions and core game mechanics are incompatible with the expectations of modern gamers and, if recreated 1:1, would result only in frustration and confusion. _PBRPGFPSPOC_ is my attempt at reimagining the gameplay of Might and Magic in a way that is faithful to the original series while also being compatible with modern game design trends.

## Scope
This prototype is only intended to demonstrate how the combat system and other minute-to-minute gameplay mechanics might work. The specifics of other RPG mechanics such as character creation, inventory management and NPC interactions are intentionally excluded as these systems operate fairly independently of the aforementioned mechanics that are the primary focus.
